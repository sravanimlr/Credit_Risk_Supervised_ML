# Credit_Risk_Supervised_ML
This project introduced various supervised machine learning testing methods and their uses for a dataset. The dataset was used to predict possible credit risk in the process of analyzing loan history. 

# Project Summary 
The project used a large dataset containing loan values. Within this, the loan status variable was analyzed for its accuracy in various test models. The more succesful model was the AdaBoost Classifier method which created a simple test. From the analysis of other models, oversampling and undersampling did not yield proper results even when used with SMOTE and without it. 

# Future Recommendations 
This project was a great overview into machine learning techniques and using the same techniques for various different datasets will provide more extensive knowledge.
